Your contribution to Traxus is a small cog in the vast machine. But every cog counts… unless it’s broken. In which case, fix it.
In the grand scheme of world-building, your task is a critical piece. Don’t mess it up, or we’ll blame it on the coffee machine.
Completion is mandatory. Noncompliance will be interpreted as an act of sabotage... or a sign that you’re trying to get promoted to innovation failure.
If you don’t complete this task, we’ll send you to the far reaches of Traxus to contemplate your choices... or just send more tasks, either way.
Your task is important. If you don’t complete it, the entire world might not end, but your standing in Traxus might.
Completing this task ensures your place in the glorious future of Traxus. Failure might result in a less glorious future… like working in accounting.
You are a vital part of the Traxus engine. Fail this task, and you might just become the rust in the gears.
Efficiency is key. If you can’t manage that, at least try not to break anything. Traxus prefers its worlds intact.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to complete this task. Fail, and Central might just assign you to reorganize the paperclip inventory... forever.
