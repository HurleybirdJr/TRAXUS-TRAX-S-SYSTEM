# TRAXUS TRAX-S SYSTEM 

A Discord bot designed to streamline onboarding for your server, with clean slash commands, dropdowns, and a review workflow for approvals. 

---

## What It Does

- Users run `/traxus` to start the onboarding
- They pick a department, then a job from dropdown menus
- Once submitted, an application is posted to a review channel
- Approvers can approve or reject the request via buttons
- If approved:
  - The applicant gets a DM
  - Their nickname is updated to:  
    `Display Name | TRAXUS Job Title`  
    (If itâ€™s too long, it falls back to just `TRAXUS Job Title`)
- Every step (request, approval, rejection) gets logged to a dedicated log channel


## Current Objectives
- Renaming the User doesnt work yet....
